## Setup

To install and set up the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Er-Simon/Telegram-Member-Booster/ Telegram-Member-Booster
cd Telegram-Member-Booster
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

1. **Add Your Telethon Sessions**: Place your session files in the `sessions` folder.
2. **Specify Group Information**: In the `consts.py` file, set the `GROUP_DESTINATION` (the group where members will be added) and `GROUP_TARGETS` (the groups from which members will be sourced). Specify the groups by providing the usernames. Additionally, the members of `GROUP_TARGETS` must be visible. It is also recommended that `GROUP_DESTINATION` has its members visible to retrieve them and avoid adding duplicates.

## Run

To start the bot:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Supported Features

- **Smart Member Management**:
  The bot attempts to retrieve existing members from the destination group, then sources new members from the target groups until it has enough.
  It excludes members already present in the destination group as well as those added in previous executions, ensuring that no duplicates are added.

- **Specify Multiple Target Groups**:  
  You can define multiple groups from which to retrieve members.

- **Fresh Mode**:  
  Members are retrieved on-demand from the target groups during each execution, ensuring the most up-to-date members are processed. This feature is enabled by default and can be disabled via the `consts.py` file. If disabled, it uses the members obtained in previous executions for the account being used.

- **Filter Mode**:  
  Filters out members based on their characteristics (e.g., fake, bot, scam accounts) and their inactivity period. This feature is enabled by default and can be disabled via the `consts.py` file.

- **Logging System**:  
  Logs all actions and operations for easier tracking and debugging.

## Usage Recommendations üìñ

- **Use Only Real Account Sessions**:  
  Always use real Telegram accounts. Avoid using accounts created with VOIP numbers or numbers from third-world countries, as these may be flagged or banned by Telegram.

- **Do Not Change Action Limits in `consts.py`**:  
  The action limits in the `consts.py` file have been thoroughly tested. Modifying them could lead to errors, restrictions, or account bans.

- **Utilize 8 Different Accounts**:  
  To maximize the growth of your group, it‚Äôs recommended to add at least 8 different Telegram session files in the `sessions` folder. This helps distribute the load across multiple accounts and ensures more efficient growth.
