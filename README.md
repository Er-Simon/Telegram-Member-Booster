## Supported Features

## Usage Recommendations üìñ

- **Use Only Real Account Sessions**:  
  Always use real Telegram accounts. Avoid using accounts created with VOIP numbers or numbers from third-world countries, as these may be flagged or banned by Telegram.

- **Do Not Change Action Limits in `consts.py`**:  
  The action limits in the `consts.py` file have been thoroughly tested. Modifying them could lead to errors, restrictions, or account bans.

- **Utilize 8 Different Accounts**:  
  To maximize the growth of your group, it‚Äôs recommended to use 8 different Telegram accounts simultaneously. This helps distribute the load and ensures better growth.
